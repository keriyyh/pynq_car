# Build your own autonomous Car
## Introduction
Enjoy your own autonomous driving car with the power of DPU and feel free to try your own AI model and new ideas.

## Material
Download the image we provided [here]() and buy the car [here](). Burn the image to your Pynq-Z2 board. To understand the whole project well, you can read the paper we published in FPT2019 [here](https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/GMvL), be relax to read the paper, it's not complex or hard to understand.

## Preparations
- Power the Pynq-Z2 in your car and run `nmtui` to connect the car to your switch(make sure your PC connected to the same).
- Read the guides in both `Host-Part/guides`, `Pynq-Part/Car/guides` and `sdsandbox/guides`(If you want to try the simulator we provided), you can start with `Pynq-Part/Car/guides/collect_guide.md`.
